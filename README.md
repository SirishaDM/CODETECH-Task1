Overview of the project
Project:Data Processing
Objective
The primary objective of a data processing project is to transform raw data into a meaningful and usable format for analysis and decision-making. This involves a series of steps, including data collection, cleaning, transformation, and analysis, ultimately aiming to extract valuable insights and knowledge from the data. By effectively processing data, organizations can gain a deeper understanding of their customers, improve operational efficiency, make more informed business decisions, and gain a competitive advantage in the market.

Key Activities
Data Collection:

Identifying and accessing relevant data sources (databases, APIs, files).
Extracting data efficiently and effectively.
Data Cleaning:

Handling missing values (imputation, removal).
Identifying and correcting errors (inconsistencies, outliers).
Ensuring data accuracy and consistency.
Data Transformation:

Converting data into a suitable format for analysis (normalization, standardization, encoding).
Creating new features (feature engineering) to enhance model performance.
